Short-cycle interactive Haskell development based on GHCID.

Note that while this uses cabal2nix, it is independent of the
production cabal2nix build in the parent directory.


ghcid.sh:

  starts ghcid with main.hs

main.hs: 

  contains the "test" to be executed by ghcid.  All dependencies
  included in this file will be compiled in interpreted mode if they
  are not specified as base dependencies.

Language: 

  Link to haskell source tree to be loaded in interpreted mode.
  Anything can be added here, with the corresponding package removed
  in the .cabal file.

gw-meta-ghci.cabal:

  specifies the base Haskell dependencies used in the linked .hs
  files.  that will be managed by nix.

release.nix:

  wrapper for the default.nix file generated by cabal2nix
